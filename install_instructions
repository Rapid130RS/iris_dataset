# Installing Python
Python can be obtained from the [Python Software Foundation website](www.python.org). Typically, that involves downloading the appropriate installer for your operating system and running it on your machine.
Some operating systems, notably Linux, provide a package manager that can be run to install Python.
On macOS, the best way to install Python 3 involves installing a package manager called Homebrew. Youâ€™ll see how to do this in the relevant section in the tutorial.
