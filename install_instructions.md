# Installing Python
Python can be obtained from the [Python Software Foundation website](www.python.org). Typically, that involves downloading the appropriate installer for your operating system and running it on your machine.
Some operating systems, notably Linux, provide a [package manager](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/) that can be run to install Python.
On macOS, the best way to install Python 3 involves installing a package manager called Homebrew.
