# Exploring the Iris Dataset through Python
# Overview
This relates to the classic Iris dataset. My objective is to understand the Iris dataset, analysis and make some insights into the dataset.
## Objectives of this work
My objecitve is to demonstare some of tha cabailities of Python in gainign insights form a dataset. I will achieve this by examining the Irish dataset and extraopotinag some finidngs.
## What is the Iris dataset?

The subejct matter of the Iris dataset is a family of 260â€“300 types of flowers. In 1936 RA Fisher published a 
[paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x "Named link title") in the _Annals of Eugenics_. RA Fisher sought to differeniate between flowers based on their characteristics. In particular, he aimed to assess whether some types (genus) were misclassified. 
The data set contains 150 records of three different types (classes) of iris flowers with numeric values for petal length and width and sepal length and width.
