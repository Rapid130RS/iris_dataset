# Exploring the Iris Dataset through Python
## Overview

This relates to the classic Iris dataset. My objective is to understand the Iris dataset, analysis and make some insights into the dataset.

## Objectives of this work

My objective is to demonstrate some of the capabilities of Python in gaining insights from a dataset to an audience who may be aware of statistical methods, but not of Python functionality. I will achieve this by examining the Iris dataset and extrapolating some findings.

## What is the Iris dataset?
![Iris](iris.jpg)

The subject matter of the Iris dataset is a family of 260â€“300 types of flowers. In 1936 RA Fisher published a 
[paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x "Named link title") in the _Annals of Eugenics_. RA Fisher sought to differentiate between flowers based on their characteristics. In particular, he aimed to assess whether some types (genus) were misclassified. 
The data set contains 150 records of three different types (classes) of iris flowers with numeric values for petal length and width and sepal length and width.

## Why use the Iris Dataset?

The data set has been used to demonstrate how features of an Iris flower can identify the class of Iris. The values for length and width can be used to classify an Iris into one of three classes: _Iris setosa_, _Iris versicolor_, or _Iris virginica_. 
In the paper, a table of values is provided; as can be seen, a visual inspection of the data does not provide any valuable insights.

Python libraries will be of pacticular use in generating visualiations of the data and in allowing the user obting a quick overview of the data.

# Utilising Python to Interpret Data

## Gaining Specific Insights using Python Libraries

At RA Fisher's published his paper, collecting, understanding and visualisng data was instensive and time consuming. Today,  organsisations and indivdiauils want to gain insights from the deluge of data coming their way. Data Sciencists have made  Python one of the most popular a way of finding these insights. Python owes it's popularity to ease of use and abilty to undertake data analysis and visualisation. Python's core capabilities are enhanced with the numerous libraries. During this project, I have used some of the most popular, including Numpy, Matploylib, Pandas and Scikit Learn.

### Matplotlib Pyplot

[Matplotlib Pyplot](https://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html) is a library that allows for creation of a wide range of data visualisations. 
Using the Pandas library, I obtianed the Iris Dataset and was able to extract descritpive statitics. I began by obtaining the mean for Sepal and Petal Width and Length.

#### Average Values for the Three Classes 

![meanValues](meanValues.png)

Using the mean values for all classes and for each of the classes did not provide any valuable insights into the differences between the classes.

I seperated the data for each class of Iris and sought to visualise the data.
An output of this was a high level analysis of the disperal of the data. 

##### High Level Analysis of Each Class

The scatter plot indicates that there are distinct differences in the dispersion of data points for each class of Iris. 

### Saeborn Pairplot

Seaborn Pairplot is an out of the box series of charts  that allowed me to visualise the relationship between the thress classes. From these charts I can quickly see how all the variables are related. This would be of help when infering
which variables have a skewed distribution and as the first step in furhter analysis.
#### Comparison of The Three Classes Using Seaborn Pairplot

This visualisation clearly shows how _Iris Setosa_ is disctinct from _Iris Versicolor_, or _Iris Virginica_ when petal sizes are compared with sepal sizes. This can be seen in the following chart.

### Predictive Analysis using SciKit Learn

[SciKit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) is a Python library that provides visualisation and predicitve analytics tools. I researched the abiulity to use SciKit to allow users check if a flower matches one of the classess of Iris. The [SciKit tutorial](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html) on this subject led my thinking. 
The [python script](https://github.com/Rapid130RS/iris_dataset/blob/master/scikit.py) allows the user to enter measurements for a flower. The predicitve analaytics functions assesses if the data matches one of the four classes of Iris recorded in the Iris dataset.

This excercise did not shed any more light on the nature of the dataset, but is a proof of concept for a furhter iteration that would parse user's inputs and conduct a more sophisticated form of predicitve analytics.
