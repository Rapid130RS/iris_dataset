# Exploring the Iris Dataset through Python
# Overview
This relates to the classic Iris dataset. My objective is to understand the Iris dataset, analysis and make some insights into the dataset.
## Objectives of this work
My objective is to demonstrate some of the capabilities of Python in gaining insights from a dataset. I will achieve this by examining the Irish dataset and extrapolating some findings.
## What is the Iris dataset?

The subject matter of the Iris dataset is a family of 260â€“300 types of flowers. In 1936 RA Fisher published a 
[paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x "Named link title") in the _Annals of Eugenics_. RA Fisher sought to differentiate between flowers based on their characteristics. In particular, he aimed to assess whether some types (genus) were misclassified. 
The data set contains 150 records of three different types (classes) of iris flowers with numeric values for petal length and width and sepal length and width.

## Why use the Iris Dataset?

The data set has been used to demonstrate how features of an Iris flower can identify the class of Iris. The values for length and width can be used to classify an Iris into one of three classes: _Iris setosa_, _Iris versicolor_, or _Iris virginica_. In the paper, the table is provided; as can be seen, a visual inspection of the data does not provide any valuable insights.
