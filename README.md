# Exploring the Iris Dataset through Python
# Overview
This relates to the classic Iris dataset. My objective is to understand the Iris dataset, analysis and make some insights into the dataset.
## Objectives
My obejcitve is to examine the Irish dataset, explain it to an audience and demonstrate how the Python Progrmamming language can analyse the dataset
## What is the Iris dataset?

The subejct matter of the Iris dataset is a family of 260â€“300 types of flowers. In 1936 RA Fisher published a 
[paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x "Named link title") in the _Annals of Eugenics_. RA Fisher sought to differeniate between flowers based on their characteristics. In particular, he aimed to assess whether some types (genus) were misclassified.
